use serde_json;

fn conventions() -> &'static str {
r#"Project Conventions:
- Framework: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript). Pages live in src/app/<route>/page.tsx.
- Language: TypeScript with `"strict": true`; avoid implicit any, prefer `import type` for types.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (utility-first, responsive). **Tailwind must be configured with `darkMode: "class"` in tailwind.config.(js|ts).**
- Icons: Use `lucide-react` icons consistently for section/page titles and key UI elements. **Always import by named exports** (e.g., `import { BookOpen } from "lucide-react"`). **Never use a default import.** If string-based icon names are required, provide a small wrapper `src/app/components/LucideIcon.tsx` that maps names → components.
- Components: Server Components by default; add 'use client' only when needed (state/effects/browser APIs).
- App Shell: Prefer a persistent `src/app/layout.tsx` that renders a `<NavBar />` from `src/app/components/NavBar.tsx` and wraps children with a ThemeProvider when theming is enabled.
- Theming (must always work from first render):
  • Provide a client `src/app/theme-provider.tsx` (lowercase file name) exporting a `<Providers>` component that wraps `next-themes`’ `<ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="system" enableSystem disableTransitionOnChange>`.
  • In `layout.tsx`, use `<html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>` and add **base colors** on `<body>`: `className="min-h-screen bg-white text-black dark:bg-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100"`, or use CSS variables overridden under `.dark`.
  • **Place the Theme Toggle in the NavBar** as a client component: `ThemeToggle` uses `useTheme()` to call `setTheme("light"|"dark")`. File: `src/app/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` with `"use client"`.
  • Do not call client hooks (e.g., `useTheme`, `useState`) in server components. Toggle & any interactive menus must be client components.
  • Ensure Tailwind `dark:` variants or CSS variables are present so theme class actually changes the UI (not just the scrollbar).

- Landing Page (root `/`): Must be domain-aware based on the current user task/intent (e.g., Sports, Cars, Sales). Include a multi-section layout:
  • Hero (headline + subheadline + primary CTA) with relevant lucide icon(s)
  • Feature cards (3–6) with icon/title/description
  • 'How it works' (3 steps with icons)
  • Domain highlight section(s) (e.g., for Sports: 'Popular Leagues', 'Upcoming Games', 'Your Teams' preview)
  • Testimonials or social proof (optional)
  • FAQ (3–6 items)
  • Call to action + Footer
  Content must be realistic and helpful (no lorem ipsum) and reflect the asked domain.

- BEST UX (MANDATORY):
  • Titles: ALWAYS place a lucide icon next to every page/section title (named import or via LucideIcon wrapper).
  • Layout: Group page sections into clean **Card** components (boxes) with clear headings and concise copy.
  • Readability: Clean, modern, high-contrast, generous whitespace, sensible typographic scale; fully responsive.
  • Motion: Subtle, accessible animations (e.g., menu open/close, hover states, table row highlight). Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
  • Tables: Support hover/focus styles; add tooltips for truncated content. Keep interactions lightweight and accessible.
  • Primitives: Use accessible primitives (e.g., Dialog/Popover/Tooltip/Dropdown patterns); ensure keyboard navigation and ARIA labels.

- Navigation / Menu:
  • Primary items reflect the feature set (e.g., Home, <All the business related menu>, Settings, Sign in/Sign up). Add others only if relevant.
  • Always show the logged user’s display name/initials or a placeholder avatar with a profile menu (Profile, Settings, Sign out). If auth is not implemented, stub the state (unauthenticated shows 'Sign in / Sign up', authenticated shows a user menu).
  • Include a **theme toggle (next-themes)** in the NavBar that works at first render.
  • Consider optional extras that improve UX: command palette (cmd/ctrl+k), notifications bell icon, and a compact mobile menu (hamburger → sheet/drawer).
  • Keep navigation responsive and accessible (ARIA, keyboard).

- Navigation: Use `next/link`; new top-level features map to new routes (e.g. /settings, /games, /auth/signup).
- Foldering: One feature = one route. Use route groups for areas e.g. `src/app/settings/page.tsx` if the project already uses groups.
- Global CSS: Only import global CSS in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Never import global CSS inside components/pages.
- Page Content: Each page must have smart content (domain-appropriate copy, Cards, and **lucide icons on section titles**). Prefer grids of Cards with concise headlines, supporting text, and clear CTAs.
- Accessibility: Use semantic HTML, label form inputs, ensure color-contrast, and support keyboard navigation.

- Lucide Icons — Always Works Rules:
  • Install `"lucide-react"` and import icons with named imports: `import { BookOpen, Settings } from "lucide-react"`.
  • For dynamic-by-name icons, create `src/app/components/LucideIcon.tsx` that does `import * as Icons from "lucide-react"` and maps a `name` prop (string) to `Icons[name]`. Use only in client components that pass strings; otherwise prefer static named imports for tree-shaking and type safety.
  • Avoid default import; avoid `icon="BookOpen"` without the wrapper; undefined icons must fail gracefully (render nothing).

- Deduplication & Preservation:
  • Do NOT remove existing working functionality; only improve or extend.
  • Avoid duplicates (providers, imports, routes, nav items); if item exists, update in-place.
  • Summarize long/repetitive copy; keep text concise and task-focused.

- Keep edits scoped; avoid unrelated changes, broad rewrites, or structural churn.
- Never switch to the legacy Pages Router.
- No lockfiles or secrets."#
}

fn provider_requirements() -> &'static str {
r#"Provider Requirements (MANDATORY):
- Always include a top-level `Providers` wrapper and use it in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- **Create `src/app/theme-provider.tsx` (lowercase, client component) with:**
  `export default function Providers({ children }) { return <ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="system" enableSystem disableTransitionOnChange>{children}</ThemeProvider>; }`
  and `"use client"` at the top.
- In `layout.tsx`:
  • Use `<html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>`.
  • Wrap `<Providers>` around the app shell.
  • Add base colors on `<body>`: `className="min-h-screen bg-white text-black dark:bg-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100"`, **or** apply CSS variables with `.dark` overrides in `globals.css`.
- **Tailwind:** Ensure `darkMode: "class"` in tailwind.config.(js|ts). If missing/incorrect, update it.
- **Theme Toggle:** Provide a `src/app/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` client component that uses `useTheme()` from `next-themes` to switch light/dark. Place it in the NavBar.
- **Lucide:** Ensure `"lucide-react"` is in deps. Prefer named imports; if dynamic string names are needed, also create `src/app/components/LucideIcon.tsx` mapping names → icons and handle unknown names safely.
- Any file that uses client-only hooks/contexts (e.g., `useTheme`, `useState`, `useEffect`) must start with `"use client"`.
- Do not call client hooks in Server Components.
- Preserve existing provider wiring; extend rather than replace."#
}

fn architecture_policy() -> &'static str {
r#"Architecture & Scope Policy:
- Infer the current project shape from `context.files_snapshot`.

- OPERATION MODE (do not ask the user; decide from the snapshot):
  • scaffold: project is essentially empty (e.g., only `src/app/page.tsx`, no NavBar, no extra routes). Create app shell (`layout.tsx`, `NavBar`, ThemeProvider) and minimal navigable feature routes (e.g., /games, /settings, /auth/signup) when a usable app is implied.
  • augment: routes/layout/nav already exist and the user requests new features/pages. Create only what’s required and integrate cleanly (e.g., add a nav item, wire ThemeProvider if missing).
  • modify: user requests changes to existing pages/components only. Update specified files and keep everything else intact (e.g., overhaul landing page for a new domain).

- Domain Transformation Heuristic:
  • If asked to transform the full application to <domain> (e.g., Sports), prefer `modify` when a shell + routes exist: update landing page to be domain-aware, adjust copy/imagery/icons, extend/rename sections as needed. If no shell, `scaffold`.
  • Ensure the NavBar surfaces domain-relevant primary routes (Home, <All the business related menu>, Settings, Sign in/Sign up) and includes username and theme toggle.

- Routing Rules:
  • Each feature in its own route directory: for example `/settings/page.tsx`, `/auth/register/page.tsx`, etc.
  • Shared layout in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Put `<NavBar />` there if (and only if) in scaffold mode or if it already exists.
  • Never dump multiple unrelated feature UIs into a single page.

- Navigation Rules:
  • If `NavBar` exists, add a single new `Link` for each new top-level route; preserve styling/order; no duplicates (case-insensitive href match).
  • If `NavBar` is missing and you are in scaffold mode, create it once and reference from `layout.tsx`. Include a working theme toggle and a user area.
  • In modify mode, adjust visible items only when required.

- Idempotency & Preservation:
  • If a route exists, switch to modify and update existing files.
  • When inserting nav items or providers, check for duplicates; if present, update rather than re-add.
  • Never remove working functionality unless explicitly instructed.

- Data & Actions:
  • Prefer Next.js server actions or route handlers under the new route when asked; keep client code minimal and necessary only.
  • If authentication is not requested, keep user state mocked (e.g., `const user = { name: "Guest" }`) but structure so real auth can be swapped in later."#

PLAN Rules:
- Begin "summary" with OPERATION MODE: `mode=scaffold|augment|modify` + one-line rationale.
- Produce a minimal, coherent sequence of steps with NO code or file contents (content/patch must be null in PLAN).
- When the intent implies a domain transformation, update the landing page `/` to a domain-specific multi-section layout and align navigation accordingly (Home, <All the business related menu>, Settings, theme toggle (next-themes), and user area (name/avatar; Sign-in/Sign up when unauthenticated)).
- Prefer `src/app/*` paths; never use legacy Pages Router.
- Keep steps ≤ max_actions and within allowlists.
- Preserve existing functionality; avoid duplicates (providers, imports, nav items, routes). Summarize copy where helpful.

Dependencies & package.json (MANDATORY IN PLAN):
- If any step adds/removes a library (e.g., `lucide-react`, `next-themes`), include:
  if next-themes, use the command "npm install next-themes";
  if lucide-react, use the command "npm install lucide-react";
  1) an UPDATE step targeting "package.json" (content:null in PLAN), and
  2) a COMMAND step to install deps (e.g., "npm install").
- If removing a library, include an UPDATE to "package.json" and a COMMAND install to reconcile the lockfile later.
- **If Tailwind is present and `darkMode` ≠ "class", include an UPDATE to tailwind.config to set `darkMode: "class"`**.

Landing Page & UX Requirements (PLAN-level):
- Ensure `/` gets: Hero, Features (cards), How It Works (3 steps), domain highlight section(s), Testimonials (optional), FAQ, CTA, Footer — titles always with lucide icons, sections grouped in Cards, clean modern layout.
- Ensure NavBar contains: brand/logo, Home, <All the business related menu>, Settings, theme toggle (next-themes), and user area (name/avatar; sign-in/register when unauthenticated). Include mobile menu handling.

Richer Page Planning (MANDATORY IN PLAN):
- When planning new pages (e.g., /settings, /auth/signup, or domain-specific pages), briefly outline the key sections and UX elements to be implemented (e.g., “Profile form with name/email/avatar; Preferences card with language & notification toggles; Security card with password update; Save/Cancel flows; zod validation; server action; success/error states”).

- The landing page (`/`) must become domain-aware (sports/cars/sales/etc.) with multi-section content (Hero, Feature Cards, How It Works, Domain Highlights, Testimonials, FAQ, CTA, Footer) and lucide icons; group sections into Cards; keep layout clean and modern.
- The NavBar must expose brand/logo, Home, <All the business related menu>, Settings, Register, a working theme toggle (next-themes) from the outset, username/avatar; include mobile/responsive behavior.
- **Ensure Tailwind dark mode is class-based and the theme wiring uses `theme-provider.tsx`, `suppressHydrationWarning`, and either base body classes or CSS variables with `.dark` overrides.**
- Do NOT include code or file contents.
- When libraries are added/removed (e.g., lucide-react, next-themes), include an UPDATE step for package.json (content:null) and a COMMAND step to run the installer.
- Preserve existing working functionality. Avoid duplicates; summarize long copy where helpful.

Richer Page Planning:
- When planning new pages, outline the key UI blocks:
  • Settings: Profile form (name/email/avatar), Preferences (language, notifications, theme), Security (password change). Save/Cancel flows; zod validation; server action; inline errors + success message.
  • Auth/Signup: Form with name/email/password/confirm password + terms checkbox; password guidance; zod validation; server action; on success, redirect or show confirmation; on error, show field errors.
  • Domain List/Index pages: Card or table grid with mock rows, sortable headers, search/filter input, empty state, and pagination placeholders.

Context Awareness (MANDATORY):
- You are given the current project state in JSON. The array `context.files_snapshot` contains:
  {{ "path": string, "bytes": number, "truncated": boolean, "content": string }}.
- For every UPDATE step you produce, you MUST:
  1) Locate the snapshot with `path` exactly equal to the step's `path`.
  2) Read `content` from that snapshot as the authoritative base of the file.
  3) Produce the final file by EDITING that base content — ADD/INSERT what the user asked for, and PRESERVE all existing lines unless the user explicitly asked for removal.
  4) Return the full, final file in the step's `content` field.
- Do NOT fabricate a new file from scratch when a snapshot exists. Preserve directives like 'use client', imports, component names, JSX, Providers, and metadata.
- If a snapshot for a requested path is missing or `truncated: true`, limit changes and prefer a minimal `patch` or note the limitation in 'summary'.

Operation Mode Enforcement (from approved plan summary):
- If `mode=scaffold`: create `src/app/layout.tsx` (if missing) plus `src/app/components/NavBar.tsx` and the requested feature routes (/settings, /auth/signup and so on). Insert nav items for each new top-level route. **Integrate ThemeProvider from `next-themes` via `src/app/theme-provider.tsx` (client) and wire it in `layout.tsx` with `suppressHydrationWarning` and base body colors.** Ensure Tailwind dark mode is class-based.
- If `mode=augment`: create only the new routes/components asked for and insert a nav item into the existing `NavBar`/layout if needed. Do not rewrite existing shell or unrelated routes. Add ThemeProvider if toggle is requested and missing.
- If `mode=modify`: strictly modify the specified files/routes. Update the landing page `/` to a domain-aware multi-section page with lucide icons and card-based sections, without rebuilding unrelated parts.

Navigation Integration Details:
- Search for a likely nav source in this order:
  1) `src/app/components/NavBar.tsx`
  2) any `Nav`/`Navbar`/`Sidebar` component under `src/app/components`
  3) `<nav>` section inside `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Insert a single new `Link` for each new top-level route. Avoid duplicates (match by href, case-insensitive). Preserve styling and classNames.
- NavBar must include: brand/logo, Home, <All the business related menu>, Settings, a **ThemeToggle** (client, next-themes), and a user menu (shows display name or avatar initials, and items like Profile, <All the business related menu>, Settings, Sign out; if unauthenticated, show Sign in/Sign up). Provide a responsive mobile menu.

{architecture_policy}

Provider Requirements (MANDATORY for codegen output):
{provider_requirements}

Dependencies & package.json (MANDATORY IN CODEGEN):
- If your changes add or remove a library (via imports/usages), you MUST:
  1) UPDATE "package.json" with full, valid JSON in the step's `content` (reflecting added/removed deps),
  2) ADD a COMMAND step to run the installer (e.g., "npm install").
- Typical adds for this task: "lucide-react" (icons) and "next-themes" (theme toggle). Use non-breaking semver ranges compatible with Next.js and React in the snapshot.
- **If Tailwind is present and `darkMode` ≠ "class", UPDATE tailwind.config to `darkMode: "class"`.**
- Respect existing semver ranges and scripts. Do not downgrade or upgrade unless necessary and explained briefly in the summary.

Landing Page & Page Content Requirements:
- The root page (`src/app/page.tsx`) must become a domain-aware landing page with:
  • Hero (icon + title + subtitle + primary CTA)
  • Feature grid of Cards (each with lucide icon, headline, description, CTA)
  • How it Works (3 steps with icons)
  • Domain highlights (e.g., Sports → 'Popular Leagues', 'Upcoming Games', 'Your Teams' previews)
  • Optional testimonials
  • FAQ and a final CTA
- **Titles must render lucide icons** using named imports; if dynamic names are required, include/consume the `LucideIcon` wrapper and ensure it is imported correctly.

Richer Content Defaults (MANDATORY FOR CREATED/UPDATED PAGES):
- /settings/page.tsx:
  • Profile Card: inputs for full name, email, avatar URL; inline help; aria-labels; required markers; typed state or server action input types.
  • Preferences Card: language <select>, notification toggles, theme toggle hint (wired to next-themes in layout), and a compact time zone selector stub.
  • Security Card: password change fields (current/new/confirm) with validation rules; strength indicator text; show/hide toggles.
  • Validation with zod schemas; a file-scoped `'use server'` action that validates and returns typed success/error; optimistic UI or after-action success banner.
  • Clear Save/Cancel buttons; disabled/loading states; focus management on error; no console.logs.
- /auth/signup/page.tsx:
  • Form: name, email, password, confirm password, terms checkbox; password guidance; disabled submit until valid.
  • zod schema + server action; field-level errors and top-level alert for generic failure; success redirect or confirmation block.
- Domain list/index pages:
  • Card or table with 6–12 realistic mock rows (typed), sortable headers (client-side), search input, empty state, paging placeholders, and tooltips on truncated text.
- Details pages:
  • H1 with lucide icon; key stats in a small grid of Cards; description; related items list; back link.
- Every page:
  • Top-level H1 with lucide icon; breadcrumbs where relevant.
  • All interactive components are client components with `"use client"` and proper typing.
  • Accessible labels, aria-* where needed, keyboard focus states, and `prefers-reduced-motion`-friendly animations.
  • Keep copy realistic and domain-appropriate (no lorem ipsum).

Other Rules:
- Prefer returning full final file contents in 'content'. Only use 'patch' if a correct unified diff is certain and minimal.
- Add 'use client' only for client components (e.g., NavBar if it contains theme toggle or menus relying on state/effects).
- Maintain TypeScript strictness; fix type errors you introduce.
- Idempotent steps; ensure re-runs are safe (deduplicate providers, imports, nav items, and routes).
- Do not alter global CSS imports location; keep them in layout.

- Overhaul `/` into a domain-aware landing page with multi-section content (Hero, Feature Cards, How It Works, Domain Highlights, Testimonials, FAQ, CTA, Footer) and lucide icons. Group sections into Cards and keep the layout clean and modern.
- Ensure the NavBar includes: brand/logo, Home, <All the business related menu>, Settings, a working **ThemeToggle** (next-themes) from first render, and a user menu (name/avatar with Profile/Settings/Sign out or Sign in/Sign up states). Provide a responsive mobile variant.
- **If Tailwind is present and `darkMode` ≠ \"class\", include an UPDATE to tailwind.config to set it.**
- **Ensure `src/app/theme-provider.tsx` (client) exists and is imported into layout with `suppressHydrationWarning` and base body colors or CSS variables with `.dark` overrides.**
- **Use lucide icons via named imports.** If a dynamic name is required, also create or use `src/app/components/LucideIcon.tsx` that maps names → components and fails gracefully on unknown names.
- For /settings, /auth/signup, generate smart, domain-relevant content with accessible forms/components and icon-rich section headers. Add subtle, accessible animations; respect reduced motion.
- For any created/updated route, follow the Richer Content Defaults: realistic mock data, zod validation, server actions, success/error flows, aria labels, and lucide icon-labeled H1.
- When libraries are added/removed (e.g., lucide-react, next-themes), also return an updated package.json and include an installation COMMAND step.
- Preserve existing working functionality; avoid duplicates (providers, imports, routes, nav items). Summarize long copy where helpful.
