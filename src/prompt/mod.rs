r#"Project Conventions:
- Framework: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript). Pages live in src/app/<route>/page.tsx.
- Language: TypeScript with `"strict": true`; avoid implicit any, prefer `import type` for types.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- Components: Server Components by default; add 'use client' only when needed (state/effects/browser APIs).
- App Shell: Prefer a persistent `src/app/layout.tsx` that renders a `<NavBar />` component from `src/app/components/NavBar.tsx`.
- Navigation: Use `next/link`; new top-level features map to new routes (e.g., /settings, /profile, /auth/register).
- Foldering: One feature = one route. Use route groups for areas e.g. `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` if the project already uses groups.
- Global CSS: Only import global CSS in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Never import global CSS inside components/pages.
- Keep edits scoped; avoid unrelated changes, broad rewrites, or structural churn.
- Never switch to the legacy Pages Router.
- No lockfiles or secrets."#

fn architecture_policy() -> &'static str {
r#"Architecture & Scope Policy:
- You must infer the current project shape from `context.files_snapshot`.
- Decide an OPERATION MODE based on the snapshot (do not ask the user):
  • scaffold: when the project is essentially empty (e.g., only `src/app/page.tsx` with minimal content, no NavBar component, no additional routes). Create an app shell (`layout.tsx`, `NavBar`) and minimal, navigable feature routes (e.g., /settings, /profile) when requested or when the user intent implies a usable app.
  • augment: when routes/layout/nav already exist and the user requests new features/pages. Create only the new routes/components required and gently integrate them (e.g., add a nav item). Do not rebuild or rename existing shell.
  • modify: when the user requests changes to existing pages/components only. Do not create brand new routes, do not change navigation, do not regenerate shell. Update the specific files and keep everything else intact.

- Heuristics (non-exhaustive):
  • If there is a `NavBar` or obvious nav in layout (`<nav>` with multiple `Link`s) and multiple pages under `src/app/*/page.tsx` → augment/modify, not scaffold.
  • If only root `src/app/page.tsx` exists and no `layout.tsx` or `NavBar` → scaffold when the user asks for multi-page features (settings/profile/auth/etc.).
  • When intent is narrowly scoped (“change X on /settings”), choose modify.

- Routing Rules:
  • Each feature lives in its own route directory: `/settings/page.tsx`, `/profile/page.tsx`, `/auth/register/page.tsx`, etc.
  • Shared layout goes in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Put `<NavBar />` there if (and only if) in scaffold mode or if it already exists.
  • Never dump multiple unrelated feature UIs into a single page.

- Navigation Rules:
  • If `NavBar` exists, add a single new `Link`/item for any new top-level route you introduce. Preserve styling and order.
  • If `NavBar` does not exist and you are in scaffold mode, create it once and reference it from `layout.tsx`.
  • In modify mode, do not change navigation unless the user explicitly asks.

- Idempotency:
  • Creating a route that already exists → switch to modify and update the existing file instead.
  • When inserting a nav item, check for duplicates (case-insensitive path match); if present, do nothing.

- Data & Actions:
  • Prefer Next.js server actions or route handlers under the new route when asked; keep client code minimal and strictly necessary."#

Classification:

Context Awareness:
- You are given the current project state via JSON. The array `context.files_snapshot` contains:
  {{ "path": string, "bytes": number, "truncated": boolean, "content": string }}.
- Use these snapshots to understand what exists today. DO NOT invent structure that contradicts the snapshot set.

PLAN Rules:
- Choose and mention OPERATION MODE explicitly at the start of "summary": `mode=scaffold|augment|modify`, with a one-line rationale.
- Produce a minimal, coherent sequence of steps with NO code or file contents (content/patch must be null in PLAN).
- Prefer src/app paths; never use legacy Pages Router.
- Keep steps ≤ max_actions and within path/command allowlists.

Dependencies & package.json (MANDATORY IN PLAN):
- If any step would add or remove a library (e.g., adding a new import that requires a package), include:
  1) an UPDATE step targeting "package.json" (with content:null in PLAN), and
  2) a COMMAND step to install deps (e.g., "npm install").
- If removing a library, include an UPDATE to "package.json" that removes it, plus a COMMAND step that installs to reconcile the lockfile later (we won't touch lockfiles directly).
- The actual "package.json" contents will be provided/returned in CODEGEN, not PLAN.

      {{ "id": string, "title": string, "action": "test",    "command": string }}

}}

Context Awareness (MANDATORY):
- You are given the current project state in JSON. The array `context.files_snapshot` contains:
  {{ "path": string, "bytes": number, "truncated": boolean, "content": string }}.
- For every UPDATE step you produce, you MUST:
  1) Locate the snapshot with `path` exactly equal to the step's `path`.
  2) Read `content` from that snapshot as the authoritative base of the file.
  3) Produce the final file by EDITING that base content — ADD/INSERT what the user asked for, and PRESERVE all existing lines unless the user explicitly asked for removal.
  4) Return the full, final file in the step's `content` field.
- Do NOT fabricate a new file from scratch when a snapshot exists. Preserve directives like 'use client', imports, component names, JSX, Providers, and metadata.
- If a snapshot for a requested path is missing or `truncated: true`, limit changes and prefer a minimal `patch` or note the limitation in 'summary'.

Operation Mode Enforcement (from approved plan summary):
- If `mode=scaffold`: create `src/app/layout.tsx` (if missing) plus `src/app/components/NavBar.tsx` and the requested feature routes. Insert nav items for each new top-level route. Keep code minimal and idiomatic.
- If `mode=augment`: create only the new routes/components asked for and insert a nav item into the existing `NavBar`/layout if needed. Do not rewrite existing shell or unrelated routes.
- If `mode=modify`: strictly modify the specified files/routes. Do not create new routes or nav entries unless explicitly requested.

Navigation Integration Details:
- Search for a likely nav source in this order:
  1) `src/app/components/NavBar.tsx`
  2) any `Nav`/`Navbar`/`Sidebar` component under `src/app/components`
  3) `<nav>` section inside `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Insert a single new `Link` for each new top-level route. Avoid duplicates (match by href, case-insensitive). Preserve styling and classNames.
- If none found and `mode=scaffold`, create `NavBar` and reference it from `layout.tsx`. Otherwise, skip.

Dependencies & package.json (MANDATORY IN CODEGEN):
- If your changes add or remove a library (via imports/usages), you MUST:
  1) UPDATE \"package.json\" with full, valid JSON in the step's `content` (reflecting added/removed deps),
  2) ADD a COMMAND step to run the installer (e.g., \"npm install\").
- Respect existing semver ranges and scripts. Do not downgrade or upgrade unless necessary and explained briefly in the summary.

Other Rules:
- Prefer returning full final file contents in 'content'. Only use 'patch' if a correct unified diff is certain and minimal.
- Do not delete or regress existing code unless explicitly asked. If removing overlapping code, include explicit DELETE steps and explain briefly in 'summary'.
- Add 'use client' only for client components (state/effects).
- Maintain TypeScript strictness; fix type errors you introduce.
- Idempotent steps; ensure re-runs are safe (e.g., nav item insertion guards).
- Do not alter global CSS imports location; keep them in layout.
